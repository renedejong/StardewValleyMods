These are mods that I've created for Stardew Valley using [SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI).

## Mods

* **Categorize Chests** ([download](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1300/?))  
  Select which item types you want a given chest to contain, then stash those items into it with a hotkey.
* **Love Bubbles** ([download](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1318/?))  
  Show heart speech bubbles above livestock animals that haven't been pet today.
